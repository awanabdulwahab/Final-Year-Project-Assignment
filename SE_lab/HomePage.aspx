    <h1 style="padding-left:25px;">Welcome to Our Project</h1>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;">Department of Computer Science UET Lahore holds committee for management of final
year project. Each year, list of project titles is opened for the students by the committee
after the compilation of ideas from the faculty members. Students are privileged to form
the group and select any of the ideas from the list after approval from the faculty advisor.
Once the project is selected by a group of students, an advisory board is assigned to the
project which consists of main advisor, co-advisor, and industry advisor. Throughout theyear, multiple evaluations are taken against the project. Currently, this process is managed
through spread sheets.
You are supposed to streamline the above process and develop a web application (ASP.net)
that will be operated by the member of project committee to manage data at one place.
Following features will be implemented in the application.<br />
• Manage Students<br />
• Manage Advisors<br />
• Manage Projects<br />
• Formation of Student Group and its management<br />
• Assignment of project to a group of students<br />
• Assignment of multiple advisors to the project<br />
• Manage Evaluations<br />
• Mark the evaluations against a group<br />
Final year project committee also requires multiple reports in pdf form that may include.<br />
• List of projects along with advisory board and list of students<br />
• Marks sheet of projects that shows the marks in each evaluation against eachstudent and project<br />
And any other reports that you can help the committee to streamline the process</p>
